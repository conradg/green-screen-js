        <h2>In-browser Chroma Key Compositing</h2>
        <main>
        <p>
        Presented here is a proof of concept of a chroma key library I'm working on.
        </p>
        <p>
        Chroma keying, or "green-screening" allows videographers to remove solidly
        colored backgrounds from videos. It is used across the film industry
        to place actors on top of backdrops that would be otherwise difficult/impossible to film
        on location.
        </p>
        <p>
        No one has yet provided a means of running this process in-browser, and
        I think that's for a number of reasons.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The HTML5 canvas technology required is still relatively new and experimental,
              and it's only just become supported across all browsers</li>
          <li>It might not be obvious what applications there are, but I think there are
            several compelling use cases. For example: a video avatar that helps old
            people navigate websites, it could walk across the page and point
            out what various buttons did. It might just end up being Clippy 2.0 but
            you never know until you try.
          </li>
          <li>
            Speed of computers. This one is probably one of the main reasons, but the
            rate at which both mobiles and computers have sped up has meant this largely isn't an issue.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          There are two distinct methods of rendering green screen in browser.
        </p>
        <p>The first method "pre-render" is to use two videos, one with the
          unaltered green screen  footage, and the other with a pre-rendered black
          and white chroma-key mask highlighting which areas of the video are to be removed.
          This mask can be generated using a professional video editing program such as
          Adobe Premiere, Final Cut or Sony Vegas. This has the downside that the
          user must have access to these, often expensive, softwares, but the benefit
          of a much higher quality output.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second method, "live render" involves determining the color of each pixel using
          the canvas API, and then using that information to make a decision on
          how it's opacity should be set. This is method is lower quality, as
          the computational power required to check a few million pixels is quite
          demanding. It can result in choppy video, and incorrectly rendered areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd like to think of some heuristics to speed up the live rendering process,
          and am also currently thinking I might use some sort of quadtree segmentation
          that starts pre-processing as soon as the page loads, and stores the data in
          some structure to be accessed in sync with the video playback, but
          my work on that so far suggests it will be difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
